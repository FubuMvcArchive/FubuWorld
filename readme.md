# FubuDocs

FubuDocs is a tool that is built on top of FubuMVC and other members of the Fubu family of frameworks. It is designed to help you keep your documentation right alongside your actual code so that *nothing* gets out of sync.

To make hosting and deployment *simple*, it exports all of the rendered documentation into plain ol' static html. You get the power of FubuMVC with the simplicity of Github pages (or anywhere else you want to host your documentation).
